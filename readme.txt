Create Access Levels and restrict any post, page, category, etc. Supports bbPress, BuddyPress, WooCommerce, WPML, and more.

== Description ==

**Restrict User Access is a fast and simple Membership Plugin for WordPress. Restrict your content in minutes, NOT hours.**

Quickly set up a membership site where your users can get different levels such as Platinum, Gold, or Free. Then, grant thoses levels when a user purchases a product in WooCommerce.

###Unlimited Access Levels

Users can have multiple access levels, and you control how long memberships should last. When an unauthorized user tries to access restricted content, you can redirect them to another URL or display a teaser.

###Level Membership Automations [NEW]

Automatically add levels to your users based on something they do (Triggers) or something they are (Traits).

* When a user purchases a WooCommerce product - get paid for memberships!
* When their Role changes
* Whether they are Logged-in or a Guest

###Contextual Content Protection

Restrict access to your posts, pages, or categories. You can even combine the conditions: protect all posts tagged "Premium" written by a select author. 

The following Access Conditions are available out of the box:

* Posts, Pages & Custom Post Types
* Content with Tags, Categories, or Custom Taxonomies
* Content written by select Authors
* Page Templates
* Blog Page & Post Type Archives
* Author Archives
* Taxonomy Archives
* Front Page, Search Results, 404 Not Found Page
* bbPress Profiles, Forums & Topics
* BuddyPress Profile Sections
* Languages (WPML, Polylang, qTranslate X, TranslatePress, Transposh)
* Pods Pages

###Restrict Content from Other Plugins

Restrict User Access autodetects Custom Post Types and Taxonomies created by any plugin or theme. Built-in support for some of the most popular WordPress plugins means that you e.g. can restrict access to bbPress forums or multilingual content.

* bbPress
* BuddyPress
* Easy Digital Downloads
* qTranslate X
* Pods
* Polylang
* TranslatePress
* Transposh Translation Filter
* WooCommerce
* WPML

###Permit & Deny Capabilities

When creating Access Levels, you also get full control over the capabilities the members should or shouldn't have. Access Level Capabilities will override the capabilities set by roles or other plugins.

###Hide Widget Areas & Nav Menus

Completely hide navigation menu items or Widget Areas created with [Content Aware Sidebars](https://dev.institute/wordpress-sidebars/) from users without select level memberships.

###Restrict Content with Shortcodes

Fine-tune content visibility in your posts or pages by adding simple shortcodes:

`
[restrict level="platinum"]
This content can only be seen by users with Platinum level or above.
[/restrict]

[restrict level="!platinum"]
This content can only be seen by users without Platinum level or above.
[/restrict]

[restrict role="editor,contributor" page="1"]
This content can only be seen by editors and contributors.
Other users will see content from page with ID 1.
[/restrict]

[login-form]
`

###Developer-friendly API

Restrict User Access makes it super easy for developers to programatically customize WordPress access control by adding a few lines of code to theme templates.

####Example - Add level to current user

`
rua_get_user()->add_level($level_id);
`

####Example - Check if current user has an active level membership

`
if(rua_get_user()->has_level($level_id)) {
    //show restricted content
} else {
    //show content if unauthorized
}
`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin through `Plugins` in the administration
1. Activate the plugin through `Plugins` in the administration
1. Have fun creating your first Access Level under the menu *User Access > Add New*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I prevent admin lockout? =

Restrict User Access has built-in lockout prevention. All administrators will by default have access to all content regardless of the Access Levels you create.

If the plugin is deactivated, any restricted content will become accessible to everyone again; Restrict User Access does not permanently alter Roles or Capabilities in any way.

= How do I restrict some content? =

1. Go to User Access > Add New
1. Click on the "New condition group" dropdown to add a condition
1. Click on the created input field and select the content you want to restrict
1. Go to the Members tab to add users who should have access the restricted content
1. Go to the Options tab to set the Non-Member Action and other options
1. Give your new level a descriptive title and save it

**Tips**
In order to restrict a context, e.g. "All Posts with Category X", simply select a new type of content from the dropdown below the **AND** label and repeat Step 3.

You can choose to negate conditions, meaning that if you negate the group "All posts with Category X", the level will get exclusive access to all content but that.

= I added a Level to a user, but it can still see other content? =

When you create an Access Level to restrict some content, only members of this level will be able to see that content, but they can still access other content too.

You can change this behavior from the Options tab by toggling "Can Access Unrestricted Content" to OFF.

With this option disabled, members can only access the content that has been restricted for this level.

To prevent lockout, Administrators will have access to all content regardless of your levels.

= Restricted content is still being displayed on archive pages or in widgets? =

By default, Restrict User Access will not hide single items from archive pages, search results, widgets or custom lists.

= Restricted file is still accessible with deep link? =

Restrict User Access does currently not support restricting deep links to files, only attachment urls.

= User still able to edit restricted content in Admin Dashboard? =

Capabilities and Access Conditions serve different purposes and are not combined. Access Conditions are applied only to the frontend, while capabilities work throughout the site (both Admin Dashboard and frontend).

= I have other questions, can you help? =
